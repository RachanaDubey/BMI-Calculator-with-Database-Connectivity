# BMI-Calculator-with-Database-Connectivity
The appropriate data structure used for this project is array of structure
   Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A high BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness. BMI can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems but it is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual.
    This project aims at making an application where a user can calculate his/her BMI     easily with the use of GUI. The formula used for calculating BMI is
 BMI= weight (in kg)/ (height (in meters)) 2              
2.1 Creating an Array of structure to store the data of a person
In this module we insert the data for calculating bmi. We insert the name of a person , weight and height and calculate the BMI of a person.
Upon which the remark is been given to user such as the user is healthy,underweight or overweight.
We create an Array Of Structure to store the data entry.
2.2 Deleting the data entry of person
In this module we delete a particular data entry given by user.
First the module ask the user to enter the name of a person to delete which then compares the name with existing data entry.If the name matches with the stored name then the data related to the person gets deleted. Or else gives the message as data not found.
2.3 Displaying the data base
In this module the data gets displayed on the screen.Here the function displays all the  data entry done previously by the user.such as
Name           Weight             Height              Bmi                    Remark
Komal            50                  173              0.193763          underweight
Priya            58                  170             0.234544             healthy
